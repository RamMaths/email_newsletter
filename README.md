I recently finished the rust programming language book, and since I liked the language I am starting to read a book about web development with this language. I will keep track of the project I will build throughout the book in this repository.

The app will have an endpoint to subscribe users to our service to let them know when a new post to a blog is made by email.

I will be using actix-web as the web-framework for this project. See the documentation [here](https://actix.rs). Postgre SQL is the dbms that I will use to store our user's data, this database will be running in a docker container since I plan to deploy this to an AWS instance.
